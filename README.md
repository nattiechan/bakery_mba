## Analysis on the transactions from a bakery using Market Basket Analysis

#### Abstract:

This project explores consumer behaviours of a bakery using Market Basket Analysis and generate insights on combo deals or promotions that potentially drive the sales of certain products. Based on the results, customers of the bakery tend to purchase coffee and bread separately, and the bakery should consider offering combo deals like Medialuna with coffee and cake with tea.
